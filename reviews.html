                <h1>Reviews</h1>
                <p>This place is run by educated, innovative & creative people! The architectural layout, seating and ambience, 
                    lighting, cutlery: servings, designs have been impeccably well thought out! Even the washrooms were excellent! 
                    The food was awesome! This is surprising considering the fact that we were there on Saturday night 
                    & they almost had no space! we were extremely well served too! Rare to find such finesse in Kenya! 
                    You must go visit them!</p>

                <p>Best place to eat out. If you want to have a nice romantic date this place is perfect. The food is fantastic, only 
                    be careful because the portions are bigger than you would expect!</p>
